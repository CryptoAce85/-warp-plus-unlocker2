  - Open the app on the phone and just connect to 1.1.1.1 or WARP (by clicking the button in the middle) if you haven't done it yet.
  - Now click the sandwich button on the right top of the screen.
  - Then click Advanced.
  - Now click Diagnostics and long press the User ID and copy it.
  - Now press this link: https://bit.ly/warp-plus-unlocker
  - That opens the unlocker program and then press the green button "Run" in the top right corner.
  - Run the program and paste the ID when asked and press enter.
  - Now you will get one gig extra in the same way as you have shared the app at repeat as long as you have the program running.
  - Enjoy the free WARP+ GBs!!
